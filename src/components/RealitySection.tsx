            <p className="text-[var(--light)] mb-3 leading-relaxed">Most dog training focuses on symptoms—pulling on the leash, not coming when called, jumping on guests. But these are just the visible signs of a deeper issue.</p>
            <p className="text-[var(--light)] mb-3 leading-relaxed">Without a clear structure, your dog makes their own rules. Without consistency, they never learn what&apos;s expected. And without proper follow-through, you never see lasting results.</p>
            <p className="text-[var(--light)] mb-3 leading-relaxed">The cycle continues: frustration builds, trust erodes, and the bond you hoped for remains out of reach.</p>

          <div className="reveal">
            <h3 className="text-3xl text-[var(--gold)] mb-2">The Solution</h3>
            <p className="text-[var(--light)] mb-3 leading-relaxed">Real transformation doesn&apos;t come from tricks or quick fixes. It comes from establishing a foundation built on three essential pillars.</p>
            <p className="text-[var(--light)] mb-3 leading-relaxed">Structure gives your dog clarity. Consistency builds understanding. Results speak for themselves.</p>
            <p className="text-[var(--light)] mb-3 leading-relaxed">This isn&apos;t about dominance or force. It&apos;s about clear communication, mutual respect, and building the relationship you and your dog deserve.</p>
